# ASH (Ares SHell) - Unix Shell in C

OS Project for Operating System Course at Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi:

## Language

 We are going with "C" as other familiar language like python has most of the low-level stuff already done and gives less opportunity to learn more about really making a unix shell. Another language option was Nim but it required us to learn Nim and then work on it, which was too much for us.

## Implementation

- Built-in functions:
  - cd
  - mkdir
  - help
  - exit
- Check for dotfile
- Run normal application example `>> subl text.txt`

## ToDo

- [ ] Using dotfile
- [ ] Add more built-in functions
- [ ] Make better ui. Colors? New Window?
- [x] Add current location to prompt
